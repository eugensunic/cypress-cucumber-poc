# cypress-cucumber-poc

1. Install the cucumber formatter for vscode because the indentations in the feature file are important.
2. Main Rule: both folder and feature file name must be equal
Example:

- integration
  - GoogleSearch
    - index.js
  - GoogleSearch.feature

3. All other instructions are to be followed on the official cucumber cypress repo:
